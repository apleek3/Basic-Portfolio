                <p>
                    Born in Oakland, California and raised in the East Bay, I'm a UC Davis Graduate that has varied experience as a Supervisor, Manager, Police Officer, Paramedic, Teacher, and Education Developer.

                <p>
                    While my coding experience is relatively new I'm currently seizing the opportunity to express a unique perspective of efficacy and creativity in my coding projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm excited to help others use tech to express themselves and find a voice that exists beyond words, websites, or wonderment.
