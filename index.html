                        I'm Alex. I have backgrounds in Pre-Hopsital Medicine, In-Hospital Patient Care Services, Standby Event Emergency Services, Security/Event Management, Education, and Law Enforcement. I began to get involved in technology in 2017 as I was serving as an educator for EMTs and Paramedics. Then as now: I use principles from the National Association of EMS Educators to teach cognitive, affective, and kinesthetic skills with a strong emphasis on professional growth and adapting to new technologies.

                    <p>
                        I graduated from UC Davis in 2008, Sacramento Police Academy in 2010, University of Nevada: Reno - REMSA Paramedic Program in 2015, and I'm currently attending UC Davis Extension's Coding Boot Camp with an expected graduation date of November 17, 2018.

                        I'm based in Sacramento where I enjoy teaching basic marksmanship, hiking, fishing, and finding new places to eat ice cream with friends.
